## Inspiration

Imagine a person who doesn't have the privilege to pursue formal education due to any number of reasons: financial constraints, remote rural locations, cultural barriers, or challenges faced in foreign lands. Curricula uses AI technology to create a tailored curriculum from free courses offered by MIT & Stanford, helping bridge this gap.

## What it does

Curricula takes in the user's learning goals (discipline, concentration, time constraints) and build a custom tailored curriculum from free courses offered by top universities around the world. Along with this, curricula also helps you keep track of your progress in your learning journey.

## How we built it

Curricula is designed to reshape online learning. With a visually appealing and user friendly frontend built on HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and frameworks like TailwindCSS, we provided an interactive and engaging experience. The backend, powered by Ruby on Rails, manages user data, and integrates courses through custom connectors. We use Google Cloud's Vertex AI to build our NLP model, which develops the curriculum. Utilizing a PostgreSQL database, we store user info & educational content.

## Challenges we ran into

Authentication with Google Cloud proved to be a real challenge. The lack of APIs for popular learning platforms (Coursera, edx) made our discipline options very narrow.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

We're proud that we able to contribute to helping bridge the educational inequalities present in our world. We all also learned a lot of about

## What we learned

We all learned a lot of about different aspects of the project. Mohammad learned how to wok with Google Cloud & use Vertex AI. Ziad learned Prompt Engineering & how to work with databases. Anas learned a lot about front-end development, specifically styling with TailwindCSS.

## What's next for Curricula

Our plan is to expand the database and have more disciplines & concentrations so we can further increase our impact in education.
